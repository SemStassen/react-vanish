# 💸 Pay up, or fade away.

Tired of people enjoying your website for free? With react-vanish, your site slowly disappears into the void the longer a customer delays payment. Watch as buttons vanish, text fades, and the entire experience turns into a ghost town.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Customizable Timer – Set how long users get before their site starts evaporating.
- ✅ Reverse Paywall – Instead of blocking content, we erase it.
- ✅ 100% Unethical – But only as an April Fools’ joke (…right?).

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Install the package:

```bash
npm install react-vanish
# or
pnpm install react-vanish
# or
yarn add react-vanish
# or
bun add react-vanish
```

2. Wrap your app in the magical `<Vanish>` component.
3. Set your payment deadline.
4. Sit back and watch users panic.
